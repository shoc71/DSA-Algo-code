# Sliding Window Technique

" Sliding Window Technique is a method used to solve problems that involve subarray or substring or window. "

- The main idea is to use the results of previous window to do computations for the next window.
- This technique is commonly used in algorithms like finding subarrays with a specific sum, finding the longest substring with unique characters, or solving problems that require a fixed-size window to process elements efficiently.
